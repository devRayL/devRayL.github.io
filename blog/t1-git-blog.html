        Version control is a tool used to manage your files. It creates a backup file of your codes, a save point, so in the event you lost your codes or wanted to review the history if some of the codes, you are able to do so because of version control.

  <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
    <p>
        Git is a system that helps the developer save the contents of their files and keep a history log of the changes made to a file. Git works hand in hand with Github. Github is where the remote master file is located. When this master file is updated on Github, the developer is also able to receive a copy of the file.

  <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
    <p>
        Github is a remote server and a interface for managing your Git projects. Github is great for storing your code because it allows the developer to collaborate with others more easily. Github is also like a management tool for coding files. It can show past work and display changes that have been made to files.
