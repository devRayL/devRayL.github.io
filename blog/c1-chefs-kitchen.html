        My first inital thoughts from watching the video is a bit of relief that there are many people going into the devboot camp with little experience as coders. I guess just knowing that there are people in the same position as me gives me comfort that I did pick the right school to attend. I felt that the curriculum was tailored more towards beginners, which is perfect for me since I'm going into this program with very little knowledge.

        As for the Devboot camp experience, it's great knowing that there are many dedicated teachers at Devboot camp that love teaching. I feel that because they love teaching and coding, then they will definately make the learning experience more engaging and exciting for us students.

        Although I do have my worries going into this program, I feel that the devboot camp culture and just the whole atmosphere will be easy for me the assimilate. I am sure many people going into this program are eager to learn about coding and have a huge passion for technology. And so because of this, I feel that I am just going to be among friends.

        My expectations of Devboot camp did not change much after watching the video. If anything it made me more excited for the next phase of the program when we are on site and just building things with codes.
